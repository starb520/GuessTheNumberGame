# Overview
Exposure to one programming language has been a learning experience. As I get exposure to multiple programming languages I feel like it increases my understanding of the why and what of programming and not just the how. As I see the different ways multiple programming languages define and initiate variables, utilize data structures, and work through organizing a program using functions and classes I feel like my comprehension is deeper and not just broader.
I wrote a guess a number game. The actual design of the game was fairly simple so I was able to put most of my time into understanding how Java works.

# Development Environment
I used IntelliJ for the programming environment and Java as the programming language. I used YouTube for tutorials about how to work with Java and install the needed programs to develop a program.

I used Java for the Guess the Number game. I used the Scanner and arrayList utility packages.

# Future Work
* Plan more complex projects for future sprints.
* Spend less time covering the basics and more time with more complex concepts like files.
* I was very conscious of the time I spent on my project, but I need to rework the schedule because I didn't have the time I thought I would.
